            <h2>When I first saw someone melting glass at age 7 I knew I wanted to do that</h2>
            <p>
                I finally got my first chance in college when I realized that there was a glass 
                program at the University of Miami, where I was studying audio engineering.  
                I started with soft glass in the hot shop in 2008, melting in front of a 2400˚ 
                glory hole in the 97˚ heat of summer in Miami.  After graduating from college 
                in 2009 I moved to San Francisco.  I couldn’t find a hot shop to work in, but I 
                found a place in Berkeley that taught flameworking with borosilicate.  It wasn’t 
                as exciting and fast paced as soft glass but I soon fell in love with the amount 
                of detail and intricacies that were possible with this more durable medium.  
                After a year in the bay I moved to Santa Fe, NM and found a studio gallery to 
                work soft glass and was able to set up a torch in my house so I could keep 
                practicing with borosilicate.  I stayed in Santa Fe for two years before I started 
                to feel like I’d hit a ceiling and needed to be around more glass blowers so I 
                moved back to Berkeley and hooked up with a really talented group of pipe makers
                 at a time when the industry was taking off.  Today I live and work in my home 
                 studio in Berkeley, CA.

                I have a mathematical mind and a love for patterns and rhythms.  I’ve played 
                music for most of my life and when I started getting more into glass the rhythms 
                and melodies I learned to play on instruments began to reappear in my work.  I 
                love making fillacellos because there are endless combinations and patterns that 
                can emerge from this simple pattern and they seem to be universally understood and 
                appreciated in the same way as music.
